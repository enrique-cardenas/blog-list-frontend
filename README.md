# blog-list-frontend

This repo contains my solutions to the exercises in [part 5](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part5) and [part 7.f](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part7/exercises_extending_the_bloglist) of the [Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course.

This application builds a frontend for the [blog list backend](https://github.com/enrique-cardenas/blog-list-backend) built in part 4 of the course. It also uses redux to manage state, and Material UI for styling.

A live demo hosted with Heroku can be found [here](https://arcane-tundra-01783.herokuapp.com/)
